Welcome to NC-NEWS

This is an application desgined to utilise API Calls to a backend created using SQL. The backend data has been hosted using heroku, and the link can request, update or delete to the server via the url:

https://nc-backend-app.herokuapp.com/api

This website shows the various requests that can be made to this endpoint with example responses.

Please Note:

- Due to limited production window time for the project, there are 2 minor changes that will be worked on later, user login for deleting relevant comments and updating votes for articles.

- If you cannot see any information on the page, try and refresh and it should work as it has been tested thoroughly. The requests may sometimes be slow!

Further instructions on how to use this web app can be viewed on the deployed site homepage.

Thank you for your time.

Technologies used: Tailwind CSS towards end of project window + React-icons, ReactJS, SQL for backend
